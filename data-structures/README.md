# Data Structures

## What is a Data Structure

A Data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively i.e., access, modify in efficient manner.

- They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
- They help to manage and organize data.
- The make code cleaner and easier to understand and maintain.
- Choosing the right data structure for the use case will make the overall product more reliable and maintainable.

## Abstract Data Type

And abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to. The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language. Examples

- ADT List, Implementations: Dynamic Array, Linked List
- ADT Queue, Implementations: Linked List based Queue, Array based Queue, Stack based Queue
- ADT Map, Implementations: Tree Map, Hash Map, Has Table
- ADT Vehicle, Implementation: Car, Motor Bike, Bicycle
