# Sorting Algorithm - Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is an efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements. Insertion sort works the way many people sort a hand of playing cards. We start with an empty left hand and the cards face down on the table. We then remove one card at a time from the table and insert it into the correct position in the left hand. To find the correct position for a card, We compare it with each of the cards already in the hand, from right to left. At all times, the cards held in the left hand are sorted, and these cards were originally the top cards of the pile on the table.

* Given the input array/list we create another empty array/list to store the sorted
* We start but looping through each element in input array/list from left to right and inserting it to the appropriate position in the output array/list by comparing the element picked
