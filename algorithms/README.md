# Algorithms

## What Are Algorithms

Simply put an algorithm is a set of instruction or sequence of computational steps that transform's the input into the desired output. It is a tool to solve a well specified computational problem. An example would be a problem of sorting a set of numbers to an ordered sequence in ascending or descending order.

Sorting Problem:
Input Sequence:  <40,34,59,34,41,56,13>
Output Sequence: <13,34,34,40,41,56,59>

Bubble Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort are some of the predefined algorithms which is a predefined set of steps to sort a given input sequence each with its own set of advantages, dis advantages and performance (BigO). Knowing these various way of solving a certain problem will allow an engineer/programmer to select the appropriate algorithm which suits his specific situation/use case, like expected input size, performance requirement (like say is it user facing application or backend database job with a low priority) etc.

## Algorithms help in providing predefined steps of steps for the below problem or problem domain

* Storage, Retrieval and Analysis of large amounts of data
* Search Engines
* Cryptography
* Enterprise Application which helps cater to many use cases in e-Commerce, Manufacturing, Healthcare, Traffic Management/Navigation, Genome/GNA/RNA sequencing/analysis etc. to list few
* And many many more use cases, mathematical/scientific problems/applications...

As you may understand algorithms have not been defined for each and every problem out there. Knowing these basic algorithms and how to approach a given problem will certainly help you in solving or developing an algorithm for the specific unique problem you are trying to solve.
