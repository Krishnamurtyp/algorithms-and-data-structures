# What Are Algorithms

Simply put an algorithm is a set of instruction or sequence of computational steps that transform's the input into the desired output. It is a tool to solve a well specified computational problem.

An example would be a problem of sorting a set of numbers to an ordered sequence in ascending or descending order. Sorting Problem:
Input Sequence:  <40,34,59,34,41,56,13>
Output Sequence: <13,34,34,40,41,56,59>

Algorithms help in:

* Storage, Retrieval and Analysis of large amounts of data
* Search Engines
* Cryptography
* Enterprise Application which helps cater to many use cases in e-Commerce, Manufacturing, Healthcare, Traffic Management/Navigation, Genome analysis etc. to list few
* And many many more use cases, mathematical/scientific problems and applications...
