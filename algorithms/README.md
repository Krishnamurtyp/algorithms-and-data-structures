# Algorithms

## What Are Algorithms

Simply put an algorithm is a set of instruction or sequence of computational steps that transform's the input into the desired output. It is a tool to solve a well specified computational problem. An example would be a problem of sorting a set of numbers to an ordered sequence in ascending or descending order.

Sorting Problem:
Input Sequence:  <40,34,59,34,41,56,13>
Output Sequence: <13,34,34,40,41,56,59>

Bubble Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort are some of the predefined algorithms which is a predefined set of steps to sort a given input sequence each with its own set of advantages, dis advantages and performance (BigO). Knowing these various way of solving a certain problem will allow an engineer/programmer to select the appropriate algorithm which suits his specific situation/use case, like expected input size, performance requirement (like say is it user facing application or backend database job with a low priority) etc., that said you would usually choose the most performance algorithm rather than say a perfect algorithm. You would in some cases want the good solution rather than waiting for ever for the best solution to the problem. An example would be to find the ideal route of a delivery vehicle such that given n delivery point you need to find the shortest and most efficient route, finding the best route from factorial(n-1)/2 possible routes, you might just go for an algorithm like nearest neighbor rather than looking and all possibilities and finding the best one. 

## Algorithms help in providing predefined steps of steps for the below problem or problem domain

* Storage, Retrieval and Analysis of large amounts of data
* Search Engines
* Cryptography
* Enterprise Application which helps cater to many use cases in e-Commerce, Manufacturing, Healthcare, Traffic Management/Navigation, Genome/GNA/RNA sequencing/analysis etc. to list few
* And many many more use cases, mathematical/scientific problems/applications...

As you may understand algorithms have not been defined for each and every problem out there. Knowing these basic algorithms and how to approach a given problem will certainly help you in solving or developing an algorithm for the specific unique problem you are trying to solve.
